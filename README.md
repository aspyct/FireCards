Roadmap (roughly)
===

1. Show contacts from a CardDav server, be able to call, send messages and mails.
2. Save contacts to the device, ignore all contacts on the device
3. Merge contacts from the server with the ones on the device (name == name based merge)
4. Upload the contacts from the device to the server, matching (name == name)
5. Do smarter merge mechanisms.
